We will study on this topic artificial intelligence and know its 
importance in many areas and how it works to increase investment 
and increase production with less cost and less time and in most of the 
time this name is called on machines or computers and it is known that 
it is like humans in some cases it analyzes the situation and issues the 
right decision Almost a lot of scientists tried to add to him the 
kindness of humanity and their humanity, but they could not, but 
artificial intelligence still helps us in a lot of work and the most 
important of which are dangerous works that a person cannot do and 
works even in any circumstances. A scientist says that artificial 
intelligence is all that has not been done Yet, for example, OCR is 
often excluded from things that are considered artificial intelligence, 
after it has become a routine technique. The capabilities of the 
modern machine generally categorize successfully human speech 
include understanding, competition at the highest level in strategic 
game systems (such as chess), autonomous operation of cars, smart 
orientation in content delivery networks, and military simulations. 
Artificial intelligence was established as an academic system in 1955, 
and in the years since then several waves of optimism have followed, 
followed by disappointment and loss of funding (known as "Amnesty 
International's Winter"), followed by new approaches and the success 
and renewal of funding. In most of its history, AI research has been 
divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other. 
These subfields are based on technical considerations, such as specific 
goals (such as "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of certain 
tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical 
differences. The subfields have also relied on social factors ( Specific 
institutions or the work of specific researchers) . The goals of AI 
research include logic, knowledge representation, planning, education, 
natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and 
deal with things and even we try to link artificial intelligence in all 
areas of life and all of our daily habits to save time and effort
