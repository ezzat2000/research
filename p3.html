Artificial intelligence :-
Computer science defines artificial intelligence research as the study of "smart factors" - any device that realizes its environment and takes measures that increase its chance of achieving its goals successfully. A more detailed definition describes artificial intelligence as "the ability of a system to properly interpret external data, learn from this data, and use that learning to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation."
Also, we must know that artificial intelligence was born in a workshop in Dartmouth College in the year 1956, where the scientist John McCarthy coined the term artificial intelligence and from here began the idea of artificial intelligence and began to develop, implement and link it in many areas.
Artificial intelligence tools: -
1- Research and improvement
2- Logic
3- Probable methods of uncertain thinking
4- Classifications and statistical learning methods
5- Artificial neural networks
And as we said, artificial intelligence is included in many applications such as (health care, cars, finance and economics, electronic security) and a lot of other things.
We will talk about the importance of artificial intelligence in some areas
1- The importance of artificial intelligence in medicine: The field of health care is developing with increasing speed, accompanied by a significant increase in the amount of data and challenges in terms of costs and patient outcomes; So artificial intelligence applications have been used to reduce these challenges, and here are the most important examples of the role of artificial intelligence in this field:
Namely (Prediction of intensive care unit transfers, medical examination)
2- The importance of artificial intelligence in the field of business: Artificial intelligence helps to enhance business capabilities in all areas, and gives companies the ability to demonstrate all their capabilities, and to raise them to the highest levels; As it increases the efficiency of businesses, the speed of their implementation, increases their value, and contributes to the continuous development of businesses, as well as the number of those interacting with these businesses, due to the continuous development of tools and software related to them.
3- The importance of artificial intelligence in daily life: it now uses artificial intelligence in cars, is used in the self-driving program and is used to reduce congestion and reduce the rate of accidents.
It is also used in e-commerce, such as Amazon sites, and is used to obtain a clear picture of customer behavior and provide recommendations
It is also used in social media, and Facebook is used to detect penetration of the user's photos
As we have explained, artificial intelligence is used in many areas, and our use and dependence increases every day.
